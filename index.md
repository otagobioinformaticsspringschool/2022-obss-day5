> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson assumes a working understanding of the bash shell. If you haven’t already completed the Shell Genomics lesson, and aren’t familiar with the bash shell, please review those materials before starting this lesson.
>
> This lesson also assumes some familiarity with biological concepts, including the structure of DNA, nucleotide abbreviations, and the concept of genomic variation within a population.
>
> This lesson uses data hosted on NeSI. Workshop participants will be given information on how to log-in to NeSI during the workshop. Learners using these materials for self-directed study will need to set up their own AMI. Information on setting up an AMI and accessing the required data is provided on the original Genomics Workshop setup page.
